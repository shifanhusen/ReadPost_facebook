# Privacy Policy for FB Page Auto Like & Share Tool

**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]

This tool is developed for personal use by the app owner to automate liking and sharing posts from a selected Facebook Page. The app uses the official [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) and adheres to all platform policies.

## 1. Information We Collect

The app **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data**. It only performs authorized actions using a valid Facebook Page access token, provided by the app owner.

- No login or authentication of external users
- No storage of user data
- No third-party analytics or cookies
- No transmission of data to external servers

## 2. Use of Facebook Permissions

This app may request the following Facebook permissions:

- `Page Public Content Access`
- `pages_manage_posts`
- `pages_manage_engagement`

These are used solely to:
- Read posts from a public Page
- Like them on behalf of my user
- Share them on my feed


**No other data or user content is accessed.**

## 3. Security

All actions are performed locally on the owner’s PC or server. There is no backend, database, or cloud server involved. The Facebook Page token is securely stored in environment variables and never shared.

## 4. Data Retention

As no personal data is collected or stored, there is no data retention policy required.

## 5. User Control

The only person using the app is the Page admin themselves. If permissions need to be revoked, this can be done directly from Facebook’s App Settings.

## 6. Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact:
